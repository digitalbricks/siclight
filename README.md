# Site Information Center LIGHT
**Getting information about sites CMS and PHP versions with one click.**

If you are a web design / development agency or a freelancer you might be familiar with this scenario: 

You have a bunch of sites with a couple of different content management systems and different server configurations under your care. Maybe hosted on different shared servers, managed by your client himself. And you never know exactly which CMS version and wich PHP version is currently running on each site without having to maintain an internal list. Sounds familiar?

**Site Information Center (SIC) fetches all that information for you with just one click. You only have to configure your sites once in SIC and every time you click SIC's refresh button you get the current version of the CMS and PHP versions in use.**
